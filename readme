This is intended for use with the Your learning course found at: https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/PLAN-B1F1F4BD5610
To deploy on Code engine an IBM cloud pay as you go plan is required. It is stated, correctly, that everything in this series is available in the free tier,
however it still requires account upgrade. No cost will be incured, however the situation is confusing.
I apologize for not being more clear.
