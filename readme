It is stated, correctly, that everything in this series is available in the free tier,
however code engine has restrictions in particular that need to be worked around if you have an IBM Cloud Lite Plan. 

To Deploy to code engine when you have an IBM cloud Lite account go to this link
and provision an instance of Code Engine on Techzone: https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/622727c90ee6a20018ab51e8

It might also be helpful to have a Quay.io or Dockerhub account & namespace ready. https://quay.io/ or https://hub.docker.com/

I apologize for not being more clear at first.
